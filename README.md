# Rive React Loading Sequence

A NextJS example app using [Rive](https://rive.app/) [low-level web runtimes](https://help.rive.app/runtimes/overview/web-js/low-level-api-usage) to build a loading screen experience displaying two Rive files on one canvas, and dynamically created artboard/state machine instances of bears.

1. `npm i` - install the dependencies (including `@rive-app/canvas-advanced`, which is the low-level runtime)
2. `npm run dev` - Starts the webpack dev server
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000`
